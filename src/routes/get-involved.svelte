    <h2>Hi! ðŸ‘‹</h2>
    <p>
      We'd love to have you involved! There are loads of ways to get involved
      with FreshAir, from presenting a show to managing music tech. Show
      applications are closed for this semester, but they'll be re-opening in
      January 2021, and in the meantime you can find out more about (and join!)
      our different teams at
      <a href="/about" style="color:white">freshair.radio/about</a>.
